/* 
Overview:
The objetive of this query is to enlist the logs of modification in the Unassigned Shifts Table in a flash view.

Usage: 
It is important to declare de variable 'original_start_at', that should be the date in investigation,and country_code, city_id and zone.id as well.
'Alignment_date' and 'release_date' refer to the dates when the forecaster first loads/reviews the forecast, and the date when the calendar is released, respectively. They are not a must, but helps undestand the process.  
There are two ways of selecting original_start_at: by a complete day, use Case A: complete day, or by slots time period, use Case B: slots
